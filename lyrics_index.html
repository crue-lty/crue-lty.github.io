        <h1>Song lyric index</h1>
        <p>A while ago my friend asked me for help with transcribing some song lyrics. I figured that I could write them down somewhere, sort them and have them sit around neatly. So this website happened :3</p>
        <p>Here it is - my project. I want to try and write down the lyrics to (some, probably not all) songs of some old obscure music projects. <br />
        Although, honestly, I might end up asking the authors for help once I get too stuck and won't be able to progress anymore. Listening to old cassette recordings is <i>certainly</i> not the easiest! <br />
        So, I'm hoping that I can get that figured out. I might write down some means of contact to myself here if you happen to stumble upon this site and want to give the songs a listen, see if you can hear something better than I can.</p>
